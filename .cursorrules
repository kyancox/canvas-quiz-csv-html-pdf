# Canvas Quiz PDF System

## Project Goal
Generate individual PDFs per question type per student from Canvas quiz CSVs and LaTeX rubrics.

## Architecture
- Config-driven: One config file per quiz
- Generic core modules work for all quizzes
- Proprietary configs are git-ignored
- HTML templates preserve student data exactly (no parsing/modification)

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Descriptive variable names
- Docstrings for all public functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Key Constraints
- Never modify student HTML answers
- Support MathJax for equation rendering
- Generate separate PDFs by question type for TA grading efficiency
